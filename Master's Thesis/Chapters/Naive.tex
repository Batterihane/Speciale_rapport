\chapter{The Naive algorithm}

In order to verify the correctness of our implementations of the algorithms, we implemented a naive algorithm to compute the MAST of two trees in a simple matter. The algorithm tries all possible combinations of leaves to prune from the two trees and picks the one giving the largest agreement subtree.

Since the number of possible combinations of leaves is exponential in the number of leaves, the runtime of this approach is at least exponential.
