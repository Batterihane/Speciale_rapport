As we will later explain from our experiments \todo{ref}, it turns out that the amount of space used by the algorithm is an important factor for the runtime when running the algorithm in practice. We will therefore in this section try to get an overview of how much space is needed by the algorithm. (and whether it can be reduced?)

We will walk through each step of the algorithm and give an analysis of the amount of space needed by that step.
