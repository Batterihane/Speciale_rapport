This thesis concerns the construction of maximum agreement subtrees between rooted binary trees. It describes two different algorithms for computing such trees. One with an upper bound runtime of $O(n^2)$ and one with an upper bound runtime of $O(nlogn)$ for input trees of size $n$. The former has a space consumption of $O(n^2)$ and the latter a space consumption of $O(nlogn)$.

The algorithms have been implemented, tested and evaluated, and experiments show that the time complexities are satisfied in practice even though the topology of the input trees affects both the runtime and the space consumption of the $O(nlogn)$ algorithm. For input trees of size greater than \textasciitilde 60, the $O(nlogn)$ algorithm outperforms the $O(n^2)$ algorithm.

A third algorithm has been implemented that reduces the MAST problem to a Longest Increasing Subsequence problem, also giving a runtime of $O(nlogn)$. This algorithm only works for input trees where each internal node has at least one leaf as a child, but outperforms the other $O(nlogn)$ algorithm.
