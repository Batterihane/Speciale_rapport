This thesis concerns the construction of maximum agreement subtrees between rooted binary trees. It describes two different algorithms for computing such trees. One with an upper bound runtime of $O(n^2)$ and one with and upper bound runtime of $O(nlogn)$ for input trees of size $n$.

The algorithms have been implemented, tested and evaluated, and experiments show that the time complexities are satisfied in practice even though the topology of the input trees affects both the runtime and the space consumption of the $O(nlogn)$ algorithm.
