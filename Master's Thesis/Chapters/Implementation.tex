\chapter{Implementation}
We have successfully implemented the algorithms described in this thesis. All implementations were done in Java 8. For representing trees we used the library located at  https://github.com/cmzmasek/forester. \\

\noindent The code for our implementations is available at: \\
https://github.com/batterihane/speciale \\

\noindent The implementation of the $O(n^2)$ algorithm consists of approximately 300 lines of code, whereas the implementation of the $O(nlogn)$ algorithm consists of approximately 3000 lines of code, excluding all libraries used. Besides that, we have created tests, experiments, etc.

The file 'readme.txt' can be found alongside the code on github. It describes the key classes to look out for and explains how to run the algorithms. Note that a recent JVM installation is required to run the program.

The test data used for testing correctness and for the experiments is located in the folder 'testTrees' alongside the code on github.
