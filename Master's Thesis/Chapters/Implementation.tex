\chapter{Implementation}
We have successfully implemented the three algorithms described in this thesis. All implementations were done in Java 8. For representing trees we used the library found at https://github.com/cmzmasek/forester. One thing to mention is that our implementation assumes that bit operations on numbers up to $O(logn)$ bits can be done in constant time. \todo{Explain why this is a fair assumption}

The code for our implementations is available at:
