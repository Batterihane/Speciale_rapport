\chapter{\todo{The NSquared algorithm}}
Goddard et. al.\cite{nsquared} describes a \todo{O(n2)} algorithm for finding the largest agreement subtree for two rooted binary trees. Given two trees T and U of size m and n, the idea is to iteratively find the largest agreement subtree and its size for every pair of subtrees from T and U. This can be done in quadratic time by using Lemma 1: \todo{\dots}
