\chapter{Implementation}
We have successfully implemented the algorithms described in this thesis. All implementations were done in Java 8. For representing trees we used the library located at https://github.com/cmzmasek/forester.

The code for our implementations is available at:

https://github.com/batterihane/speciale

The implementation of the $O(n^2)$ algorithm consists of approximately 300 lines of code, whereas the implementation of the $O(nlogn)$ algorithm consists of approximately 3000 lines of code. Besides that, we have created tests, experiments, etc.

The file 'readme.txt' describes the content and explains how to run the algorithms.
